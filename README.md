# AI-Based Smart Traffic Management System for Urban Congestion 🚦

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Based Smart Traffic Management System** is an intelligent, web-based solution designed to analyze real-time traffic conditions and assist authorities in managing urban congestion efficiently. The system leverages computer vision and data-driven analytics to improve traffic flow, reduce delays, and enhance road safety.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Rapid urbanization has led to increased vehicle density, causing frequent traffic congestion, delays, higher fuel consumption, and safety risks. Traditional traffic systems rely on static signal timings and manual monitoring, which fail to adapt to real-time traffic variations.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project uses **AI-powered vehicle detection and traffic analysis** to:
- Monitor real-time traffic conditions
- Identify congestion levels
- Provide adaptive signal timing suggestions
- Support quick and data-driven decision-making for traffic authorities

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🚗 Vehicle detection using computer vision  
- 🔢 Vehicle counting and traffic density analysis  
- ⚠️ Congestion level classification (Normal / Moderate / Severe)  
- 📊 Speed and traffic statistics visualization  
- 🚦 Adaptive signal timing suggestions  
- 🖥️ User-friendly dashboard for authorities
